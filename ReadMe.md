# Sam's Spelling Bee

A web app to perform a spelling test.  

I created this app to help my son learn his spellings for school by himself.

## How to use

- Add the spellings using the `Edit List` button
  - Spellings can be added or deleted here
- View the spellings using the `View Spellings` button
  - The order of the Spellings can be re-arranged here
- Start the test using the `Start Test` button once spellings are added.
  - Click the `Play Spelling` button to hear the spelling.
  - Click `Next` to continue through the spellings.
  - Click `End Test` once the test is complete to view the list of spellings.

## FAQs

**Q: Why isn't there a text box to type the spelling, and a button to say Correct?**

**A:** I wrote the app so that the person being test would have to write the speeling to improve hand writing, and also to avoid autocomplete in mobile device keyboards.
